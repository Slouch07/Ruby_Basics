Q: Given the array of several numbers below, use an until loop to print each number.

numbers = [7, 9, 13, 25, 18]

My A: 

counter = 1
until counter > 5
  numbers.each do |num| 
  puts num 
  counter += 1
  end
end

LS A:

count = 0

until count == numbers.size
  puts numbers[count]
  count += 1
end

Using count helps us in two ways. First, it lets us control the number of iterations. 
In this case, we want to stop iterating when count equals the length of numbers. 
Second, we use it to select the next value in the array. This works because count matches the 
index of each number we want to print.
