Q: What will the following code print, and why?

array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |element|
  a = element
end

puts a

My A: Output is 3 - because the each method will iterate over 
      each element placing it in 'a' but as the puts is outside
      the each method, it will print the last stored element.

LS A: Output is error - because there was no 'a' variable initialized
      and when you try to puts 'a' it will throw the error. 'a' 
      inside the method block is only seen internally.
