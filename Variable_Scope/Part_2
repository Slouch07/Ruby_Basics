Q: What will the following code print and why?

a = 7

def my_value(a)
  a += 10
end

my_value(a)
puts a

A: Output is 7.
This is the same scenario as part 1. Just because the b has
changed to an a doesn't mean it will change the value store in
a. The method cannot see the variables outside itself.
