# Q: Create an empty string using the String class and assign it to a variable.

# My A:
string = ""

# LS A:
# empty_string = String.new

# In Ruby, strings can be created in multiple ways. Empty strings, however, can only be 
# created in two ways. In the solution, we use one of the two ways, which is invoking 
# String's ::new class method.
